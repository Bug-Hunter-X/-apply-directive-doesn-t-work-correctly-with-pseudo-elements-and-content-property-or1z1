This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with directives that modify the `content` property, such as `before` or `after`.  The `content` property is not correctly applied when using `@apply` in conjunction with these directives. For example:

```html
<div class="relative">
  <div class="absolute top-0 left-0 @apply before:content-['âœ¨']"></div>
</div>
```

This might result in the `before` pseudo-element not showing the expected content.
